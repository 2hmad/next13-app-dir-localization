    "alfaisaliah-paragraph-2": "In 1942, Chef Boubier gifted his secret recipe to his daughter and her husband the new owners of “Café de Paris” restaurant who came up with the idea of offering a Single Menu Formula consisting of a Green Salad, 200 grams of Entrecôte Steak with “Café de Paris” sauce and homemade French Fries. This simple formula gained immediate worldwide fame and success. Many restaurateurs around the world tried to imitate our set formula and our “Café de Paris” sauce but never equaled our distinctive taste and texture which explains our motto “Toujours Imitée, Jamais Egalée”.",
